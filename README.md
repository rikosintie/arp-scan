# arp-scan
Creates several arp-scan commands to help locate an unused IP address on a LAN or locate a device patched on a port that is configured on the wrong vlan.

Based on the blog:
[Use Arp-scan to find hidden devices in your network](https://www.blackmoreops.com/2015/12/31/use-arp-scan-to-find-hidden-devices-in-your-network/) by Blackmoreops.com

# Installation #
This script uses the Python 3 netifaces library to build the list of interfaces.

* git clone https://github.com/rikosintie/arp-scan.git
* sudo apt install python3-dev
* sudo apt install python3-pip
* pip3 install netifaces
* cd arp-scan 
* python3 arp-scan.py

# Finding an open IP address
The commands are executed from the script and the results returned to the screen. Arp is a layer 2 protocol so the subnet you enter must be on the same vlan as the port you are connected to if you are looking for an open IP Address. The advantage to using ARP over ICMP is that devices with firewalls may not reply to ICMP but they should reply to arp. 

# Locating a device that is patched on into a port configured on the wrong vlan
Menu item 2 is different. It is designed to arp devices that got patched back in wrong during a cutover and now don't respond to ping. To use this script, you must be connected to a port that allows tagged traffic on the vlan the device is configured for. Since this is a layer two protocol you don't need a valid IP address on your laptop.

See 
[Using arp-scan to find a free ip address](https://mwhubbard.blogspot.com/2017/04/using-arp-scan-to-find-free-ip-address.html) 

and

[Locate ip devices on the wrong vlan](https://mwhubbard.blogspot.com/2019/02/locate-ip-devices-on-wrong-vlan.html)

for detailed instructions.

On *nix systems use ```python3 arpscan.py``` to execute

This should work on Windows 10 running Windows Subsystem for Linux. If you try it and have any problems please open an issue by clicking the "Issues" link above.

You may have to install arp-scan on your system using your package manager. For Ubuntu "sudo arp install arp-scan".
If your distro doesn't have arp-scan you can download it from [Roy Hill's Github](https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)

If you create a file named "ip.txt" in the folder where you run the script it will load the 
IP address as a default and use it where an ip address is needed. The file should have one 
line - the ip address or netork and mask (Ex. 192.168.10.0/24) to use.

Usage
```
Look for an open IP address.
Script usage
0 Initial arp-scan output
1 Enter two unused IP addresses
2 Scan for a lost device

Input a number to select 0
Enter an IP Address or network - use /24 style mask: [192.168.10.0/24]:
